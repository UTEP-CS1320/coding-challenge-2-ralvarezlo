### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

This program will read two inputs pertaining to the Systolic and Diastolic pressure readings and will classify it into
pertaining groups recognized by The American Hear Association (Normal, Elevated, Stage 1 Hypertension, Stage 2
Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis).

In order to reduce the if-statements I grouped the simple boolean conditions and grouped them with short circuit 
evaluations, starting from the higher ranges all the way to the lower in order to avoid multiple redundant checks.
